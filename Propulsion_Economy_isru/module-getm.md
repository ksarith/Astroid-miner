GETM — Gas Extraction & Thrust Module

Role Summary

Primary role
High-thrust propulsion module optimized for rapid transit and logistics across the outer solar system (≈5–19 AU), with integrated atmospheric gas extraction to support fleet-scale fuel and material supply.

Secondary capability
Atmospheric resource harvesting (H₂, He, trace gases) from gas giants to bootstrap propellant, power, and long-duration operations.

Supplemental capability — Mass-Ejection Propulsion (“Uranus Ejector”)
Waste material (volatile excess, regolith fines, failed prints, spent reactants) may be expelled as directed reaction mass for efficiency gains.

This system is supplemental, not primary. It supports station-keeping, despin, momentum exchange, emergency Δv, and dead-mass elimination, but does not replace dedicated propulsion or power-driven thrust systems. Performance is opportunistic and bounded by waste stream availability and composition.

Tertiary capability
Rogue-unit recovery: detection, interception, and physical disablement or capture of non-compliant swarm elements (low probability, high consequence risk mitigation).

Design Rationale

Thrust-first architecture: Transit time, not extraction rate, is the dominant bottleneck for outer-system scaling.

Integrated ISRU: Scooping is secondary but strategically critical for fuel independence and logistics resilience.

Waste-as-resource philosophy: Non-product mass is minimized wherever safely possible.

Safety-first governance: High-thrust and interception modes are gated behind ethical AI controls and consensus checks.
