# Low-Value Acquisitions Strategy

The swarm deliberately targets the most abundant, lowest-value materials first — because they close the mass loop fastest.

## Priority order (early bootstrap phase)

1. **H₂O** — water ice / hydrated minerals  
   - Why first: easiest to vaporize, electrolyze, or eject  
   - Uses: moisture for dust reduction, O₂ production, propellant (H₂/O₂)  
   - Sources: Phobos (10¹⁸ kg), C-types, some NEAs  

2. **CO₂** — adsorbed & polar cap  
   - Why: sublimates easily → quick pressure bump (0.1 bar CO₂)  
   - Uses: greenhouse warming, Sabatier CH₄ production  
   - Sources: Mars regolith & poles (10¹⁸ kg available in-place)

3. **Silicates** — regolith fines  
   - Why: everywhere, easy to mine, feedstock for SiC & CNT printing  
   - Uses: structure, shielding, solar panel frames  
   - Sources: NEAs, Phobos, Mars surface

4. **Fe/Ni metals** — iron-nickel grains  
   - Why: structural & magnetic material, byproduct of silicate processing  
   - Uses: module hulls, drill bits, magnetic coils  
   - Sources: M-types, ordinary chondrites

5. **Carbon / CH₄** — carbonaceous chondrites  
   - Why: propellant for Uranus Ejector, CNT feedstock  
   - Uses: high-Δv thrust, superconductor precursors  
   - Sources: C-types (10% of NEAs)

## Guiding rules

- If it can be turned into propellant or structure → prioritize it  
- If it’s rare / high-value (PGEs, REEs) → deprioritize until replication loop is closed  
- If it helps close a feedback loop (H₂O → moisture → dust reduction → laser efficiency) → move it to the top  

## Open questions

- Minimum H₂O delivery rate to trigger meaningful dust reduction feedback  
- CO₂ release efficiency from regolith vs polar cap  
- When does Fe/Ni mining overtake silicate mining in priority?  
- CH₄ sourcing bottleneck — Sabatier vs direct C-type mining  

This strategy is deliberately “waste-first” — it maximizes the chance of closing the first replication loop with minimal Earth dependency.
