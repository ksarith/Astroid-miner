# Uranus Ejector as Primary Propulsion Mechanism

The Uranus Ejector is the swarm’s workhorse propulsion system: it turns non-product mass (mining tailings, excess regolith, Jonesboro-style organic/volatile waste, spent coolant, off-spec parts) into high-velocity reaction mass.

## Core idea

- Every gram that is **not** refined product or structure should ideally become propellant.  
- Baseline ejection velocity target: 10 000 m/s  
- Propellant: gaseous CH₄ (primary), H₂O dissociation products, CO₂, or metal-oxygen cycles  
- Specific impulse range: 3 000–4 500 s (very high for chemical propulsion)  
- Thrust class: 10–100 N per module (scalable)  

## Waste streams suitable for ejection

- C-type asteroid CH₄ & volatiles  
- Regolith fines & dust not used in CNT/SiC printing  
- Excess H₂ from water electrolysis  
- Sabatier byproducts (when making CH₄ from CO₂ + H₂)  
- Organic waste from early Jonesboro bootstrap phase  
- Failed prints / off-spec parts  

## Targeting capability

- Precision: ±0.1° gimbal + AI vectoring  
- Use cases:  
  - Direct delivery of H₂O/CO₂ vapor to Mars polar regions (terraforming)  
  - Momentum exchange with orbital depots or cyclers  
  - Despin / station-keeping without dedicated tanks  
  - Emergency high-Δv escape or intercept  

## Advantages

- Eliminates “dead mass” penalty — waste becomes Δv  
- Reduces need for Earth-sourced propellant after bootstrap  
- Enables targeted atmospheric seeding (moisture → dust reduction → laser efficiency loop)  

## Limitations & open questions

- Thrust-to-weight ratio at small module scale (10–100 kg class)  
- Nozzle erosion from silicate dust in exhaust  
- Minimum viable CH₄ concentration in feed gas  
- Safe disposal vectoring to avoid Kessler risk  

This mechanism is foundational — almost every other propulsion strategy builds on or complements it.
