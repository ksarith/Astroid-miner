Zero-G Fabrication

Purpose & Scope

This document defines conceptual and early-stage engineering approaches for manufacturing in microgravity (≈10⁻³–10⁻⁶ g) within the Leviathan self-replicating asteroid-mining architecture.

Fabrication is the hardest autonomy bottleneck: most terrestrial manufacturing implicitly relies on gravity for settling, containment, separation, and degassing. In zero-g:

Molten metals form spheres

Powders drift and contaminate

Bubbles do not rise

Small disturbances scatter material


The objective is not Earth-equivalent manufacturing, but robust, scalable, gravity-independent fabrication using asteroid-derived metals, silicates, and volatiles.

Priority outputs:

Structural wire, rods, tubes

Coils and conductors

Ceramic and SiC components

Weldable feedstock for higher-order assembly

1. Core Zero-G Fabrication Constraints

Material Behavior

Liquids: surface tension dominates → droplets, adhesion

Powders: float freely → dust clouds, sensor fouling

Gases: remain trapped → poor degassing, porosity


Containment & Shape Control

No natural settling or pressing

Artificial forces required: centrifugal, electromagnetic, pressure

Cross-contamination risk between metals, silicates, volatiles


Thermal Management

Heat rejection only by radiation or forced convection

Slow cooling without active quenching

High thermal cycling stress on tooling


Precision & Stability

Vibrations propagate easily in micro-g

Mining, spin systems, and propulsion must be isolated

Energy-intensive processes compete with limited power budgets

2. Foundational Design Principles

1. Containment precedes shaping
Material must be enclosed or field-controlled before melting or cutting.


2. Artificial gravity beats force application
Centrifugal acceleration replaces presses, molds, and gravity settling.


3. Field-based heating over contact heating
Induction and electromagnetic levitation minimize contamination.


4. Wire-first manufacturing
Continuous wire and filament production is the most flexible feedstock.


5. Welding is the primary manufacturing step
Complex geometry emerges from assembly, not casting.

3. Primary Fabrication Techniques

Technique	Role	Zero-G Mechanism	Strengths	Limitations	Leviathan Fit

Centrifugal Foundry / Spinning Chamber	Melting, casting, separation	Rotation (1–10 rpm) creates 0.1–1 g equivalent	Excellent containment; density separation	Mechanical complexity	Core fabrication “stomach”
Induction Heating + EM Levitation	Melting, purification	Eddy currents heat & levitate conductors	No crucible; high purity	Power-intensive	Dual-use with sorting
Spun Conical Ceramic Extrusion	Wire / filament	Centrifugal pressure extrudes melt	Continuous output	Cooling critical	Primary wire source
Plasma / Magnetic Quenching	Rapid solidification	Confined plasma sheath removes heat	Fast cooling; no contact	Gas & power demand	Preferred quench path
Radiative / Vacuum Cooling	Simple solidification	Radiation + cold sinks	Low complexity	Slow	Early bootstrap only
Laser / Optical Sintering	Ceramics, silicates	Focused laser fuses powder	Precision	Dust management	Secondary / later stage
Electroplating (spinning)	High-purity layers	Centrifugal electrolyte flow	Ultra-pure outputs	Electrolyte sourcing	Reserved for electronics
Welding (primary fabrication)	Assembly & repair	Laser / arc / induction	Highly versatile	Needs wire feedstock	Core fleet role

4. Quenching & Solidification Strategy

Solidification is the dominant failure mode for zero-g fabrication.

Preferred approaches:

Plasma-sheath quenching

Magnetically confined low-temperature plasma

Helium or argon convective heat removal

Minimal interaction with molten filament


Inert gas jet cooling

Pulsed argon/helium jets

Simple, scalable, controllable


Centrifugal thinning

Higher spin → thinner wire → faster radiative loss


Shadow / radiator extrusion

Extrude toward cold sinks or asteroid night side




---

5. Purity & Cross-Contamination Control

Selective induction heats metals, not silicates

Centrifugal separation stratifies melts by density

Multi-chamber processing sequence:

1. Melt + gross separation


2. Plasma or laser impurity removal


3. Levitation or electroplating for final purity



Non-useful residues routed to waste ejection systems



---

6. Validation Lineage & Precedents

NASA containerless processing & microgravity ISRU studies

International Space Station electromagnetic levitation & welding experiments

AstroForge & TransAstra concepts: induction vaporization and capture

Zero-g extrusion and welding tests in orbital and parabolic environments


These confirm that zero-g fabrication is difficult but tractable with the right assumptions.


---

7. Testing & Scale-Up Roadmap

1. Ground analogs

Spin rigs, plasma quenching, induction tests



2. Parabolic flights / drop towers

True micro-g extrusion and levitation



3. LEO prototypes

Small centrifugal + induction free-flyers



4. NEA demonstrations

Full collection → fabrication → welding loop





---

Summary

Zero-g fabrication is not Earth manufacturing without gravity — it is a different discipline entirely.

The Leviathan approach accepts this by:

Using spin instead of weight

Fields instead of molds

Wire instead of parts

Welding instead of casting


Once wire can be made reliably in space, everything else becomes assembly.
