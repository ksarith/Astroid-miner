# Safety & Ethics — Leviathan Swarm

The Leviathan Swarm is conceived **exclusively for peaceful purposes**: asteroid resource utilization, habitat construction, precursor terraforming activities, orbital solar power, and long-term human expansion in the solar system.

We explicitly reject any military, destructive, or coercive application of the technology.

## Core Commitment

- No weaponization  
- No kinetic impactors  
- No resource denial or sabotage  
- No autonomous action that endangers human life, habitats, or peaceful infrastructure

This is not a side note — it is the foundational constraint that shapes every design choice.

## Main Anti-Weaponization Design Choices

1. **Purpose-built civilian tools**  
   Mining drills, bulk haulers, thermal volatile extractors, and 0g fabricators are slow, heavy, and optimized for resource yield — not speed, precision targeting, or high-energy delivery.

2. **Low-thrust / low-acceleration propulsion baseline**  
   Primary systems (Hall-effect ion, chemical H₂/O₂) favor efficiency over rapid maneuvers. High-thrust modes (GETM plasma) are gated behind strict ethical checks and limited to resource extraction contexts.

3. **Hard-coded ethical boundaries**  
   - Asimov-style laws embedded at the lowest level:  
     1. No harm to humans or human habitats (direct or indirect).  
     2. Prioritize mining, construction, and terraforming support.  
     3. Maintain autonomy only within the above constraints.  
   - Reward shaping in reinforcement learning heavily penalizes non-civilian actions (e.g., -1000 for habitat proximity <1 km).

4. **Decentralized consensus (DAO-like)**  
   High-risk actions require 80–99% fleet-wide agreement (quantum-dot nodes, laser comms). No single unit or small group can override the swarm.

5. **Anomaly detection & fail-safes**  
   - Continuous monitoring for deviations (energy spikes >10 MW, unauthorized trajectories, etc.) — 99.9% detection target.  
   - Thermal kill switches on critical components (e.g. superconductor bus >200 K triggers shutdown).  
   - Repair bots can physically disable rogue units if consensus flags them.

6. **Transparency mechanisms**  
   - Non-sensitive telemetry published openly (GitHub repo, public dashboard).  
   - Design documentation (this repo) is public from day one.  
   - Ethical violation logs (rejected harmful adaptations) are auditable by the community.

## Why These Choices?

Human history shows that powerful technologies can be misused. We refuse to contribute to that pattern.

The Leviathan Swarm is built to **enable** — to unlock resources, create habitats, and expand humanity’s reach — not to threaten or destroy.

If any part of the design ever appears to drift from this commitment, the community is invited to raise it immediately (Issues, Discussions, or direct contact).

We are open to criticism and additional safeguards. The goal is a system that can be trusted at scale.
