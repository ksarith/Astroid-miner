00 — Vision & Long-Term Horizon

This repository is an open, evolving notebook exploring concepts related to industrial-scale asteroid mining and the bootstrapping of large, off-world industrial capacity.

The very long-term objective is to help make a multi-planetary industrial civilization technically, economically, and energetically feasible within roughly the next 100–150 years.

This is not a prediction. It is an exploration of what might be required if such a future is to exist at all.

Core Premise

Humanity’s expansion beyond Earth is currently constrained by several tightly coupled bottlenecks:

Launch cost and payload mass to orbit

Reaction mass and propellant economics in space

Energy availability at scale beyond low Earth orbit

The absence of self-expanding industrial infrastructure off-world


Asteroid mining, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), and self-replicating or self-expanding manufacturing loops are among the few approaches that could plausibly relax all four constraints at once.

If even modest mass-closure loops can be achieved—on the order of tens to thousands of tonnes per year—then large portions of the solar system become accessible in ways that Earth-supplied chemical rocket architectures cannot realistically support.

Why Asteroid Mining

Asteroids—particularly near-Earth asteroids (NEAs)—are a logical bootstrap target for several reasons:

Low delta-v accessibility: many NEAs have round-trip Δv < 7 km/s from LEO, with some well below 4 km/s

Resource diversity in a single body: volatiles (H₂O, CO₂, NH₃), metals (Fe, Ni, Co, PGEs), silicates, and carbon

Minimal gravity wells: escape velocities of ~10–100 m/s on small bodies

No atmosphere or weather: continuous solar availability and no aerodynamic losses

Exponential scaling potential: once mining and refining capacity can replicate itself, growth becomes geometric rather than linear


Main-belt asteroids and lunar resources are likely longer-term complements, but NEAs represent the most practical initial foothold.

Guiding Philosophy

The ideas in this repository are shaped by a few pragmatic assumptions:

Start small, ugly, and cheap
The first self-expanding systems do not need to be elegant or profitable. They need to close the mass loop.

Waste is propellant
Any mass not retained as product should ideally serve as reaction mass—whether via water, methane, metal-oxygen cycles, or momentum-exchange systems.

Minimize Earth dependency after bootstrap
Once a ~10–100 tonne/year loop is closed, most inputs should come from space-derived resources.

Redundancy beats optimization early
Early replicating systems will fail frequently. Fault tolerance, graceful degradation, and swarm-level robustness matter more than peak efficiency.

Truth is source-agnostic
Useful insights may come from academic papers, obscure forum posts, historical studies, or even science fiction. Origin matters less than correctness.

Forethought prevents cascading failure
Issues like debris generation, runaway replication, reaction-mass starvation, and single-point failures must be considered early—even if solutions are incomplete.

Uncertainty is the default state
Nearly every number in this repository should be treated as provisional until validated by simulation, experiment, or real-world data.

What “Success” Looks Like (Long-Term)

Success is not a single company, mission, or government program.

It is a future where thousands of semi-autonomous industrial nodes operate across the inner and outer solar system—each capable of reproducing itself given sufficient time and feedstock.

At that point, launch cost from Earth becomes largely irrelevant for large-scale infrastructure. The central question shifts from “What can we afford to launch?” to “How fast can the initial seed population grow?”

Where This Repository Fits

We are very far from that outcome.

Today we have:

Mostly conceptual or lab-scale academic research

A small number of private efforts at roughly TRL 3–5

No publicly available, end-to-end system model that closes the mass and power loop at meaningful scale (>1 t/year)


This repository attempts to collect partial answers and, where possible, turn them into:

Runnable or parametric models

Mass and power budgets

Architecture trade studies

Curated reference lists

Explicit lists of unknowns and failure modes


This is not a roadmap, a business plan, or investment material.

It is a public scratch-pad.

If any part of it proves useful—fork it, critique it, improve it, or discard it. Whatever moves understanding forward.

Happy (slow, ugly, incremental) mining ☄️
