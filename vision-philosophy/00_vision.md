# 00 – Vision & Long-term Horizon

This repository is an open, evolving notebook of ideas around industrial-scale asteroid mining and the bootstrapping of large off-world industrial capacity.

The ultimate (very long-term) goal is to help make multi-planetary industrial civilization technically, economically and energetically realistic within the next 100–150 years.

## Core premise

Humanity is currently bottlenecked by:
- Launch cost + payload mass to orbit
- Reaction mass / propellant economics in space
- Energy availability at scale beyond LEO
- Lack of self-expanding industrial infrastructure in space

Asteroid mining + in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) + self-replication / exponential manufacturing loops are among the few pathways that can plausibly relax all four constraints simultaneously.

If those loops can be closed at small-to-medium scale (tens to thousands of tonnes/year), the rest of the solar system becomes accessible in a way that chemical rockets + Earth supply chains never can.

## Why focus on asteroid mining specifically

- Near-term accessibility: NEAs have Δv < 7 km/s round-trip from LEO, many < 4 km/s
- Diverse resource mix in one place: volatiles (H₂O, CO₂, NH₃), metals (Fe, Ni, Co, PGEs), silicates, carbon
- No deep gravity wells: escape velocities 10–100 m/s on small bodies
- No atmosphere drag or weather: continuous solar power, no dust storms after initial clearing
- Exponential scaling potential: once you can mine and refine enough mass to replicate the mining/refining capacity, growth becomes geometric rather than linear

Main-belt asteroids and lunar material are longer-term complements; NEAs are the logical bootstrap location.

## Guiding philosophy (in no particular order)

- **Start small, ugly, and cheap** — the first self-expanding system does not need to be beautiful, elegant, or even profitable. It needs to close the mass loop.
- **Waste is propellant** — every gram of non-product that leaves the mining site should ideally become reaction mass (CH₄, H₂O dissociation, metal-oxygen cycles, momentum exchange tethers…).
- **Minimize Earth dependency after bootstrap** — once the first ~10–100 t/year loop closes, almost everything should come from space resources.
- **Redundancy > optimization early on** — the first replicating systems will fail a lot. Design for fault tolerance, graceful degradation, and swarm-level robustness.
- **Truth is truth, no matter who says it** — if a 1960s paper, a random forum post, or a sci-fi novel contains a correct insight, use it.
- **A little forethought can save a whole lot of heartache** — especially around Kessler syndrome, rogue unit protocols, reaction mass starvation, and single-point failure modes.
- **The only certainty is that we know very little** — treat every number in this repo as provisional and wrong until proven otherwise by simulation or experiment.

## Success looks like (very long term)

Not a single company or government project, but thousands of independent, semi-autonomous industrial nodes across the inner and outer solar system, each capable of replicating itself given time and feedstock.

At that point launch cost from Earth becomes almost irrelevant for large-scale infrastructure — the question shifts to “how fast can we grow the seed population?”

## Where this repo fits in

We are still very far from that picture.

What exists today:
- Academic papers (mostly conceptual or lab-scale)
- A handful of private companies at TRL 3–5
- No public, reproducible, end-to-end system model that closes the mass/power loop at >1 t/year scale

This repo tries to collect fragments and — when possible — turn them into:
- Runnable parametric models
- Mass & power budgets
- Architecture trade studies
- Reference lists
- Honest lists of what we still don’t know

It is not a roadmap, not a business plan, not investment material.  
It is a public scratch-pad.

If you find any part useful — fork it, improve it, criticize it, ignore it, whatever helps move the ball forward.

Happy (slow, ugly, incremental) mining ☄️
