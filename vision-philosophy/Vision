# Vision & Long-Term Horizon

This repository is an open, evolving notebook exploring concepts related to **industrial-scale asteroid mining** and the **bootstrapping of large off-world industrial capacity**.

The very long-term objective is to help make a **multi-planetary industrial civilization** technically, economically, and energetically feasible within roughly the next **100–150 years**.

This is not a prediction or a roadmap. It is an exploration of what may be required if such a future is to exist at all.

## Core Premise

Humanity’s expansion beyond Earth is currently constrained by several tightly coupled bottlenecks:

- Launch cost and payload mass to orbit  
- Reaction mass and propellant economics in space  
- Energy availability at scale beyond low Earth orbit  
- The absence of self-expanding industrial infrastructure off-world
