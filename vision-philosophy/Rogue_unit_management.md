Rogue Unit Management — Lazarus Forge / Astroid Miner

This document defines the canonical procedures for detecting, containing, and managing rogue or malfunctioning autonomous units. The goal is to preserve units whenever possible, ensuring life preservation and system integrity while maintaining swarm stability.

All procedures defer to the Ethical Hierarchy Block (EHB):

Level 0 — Preservation of sentient life

Level 2 — System stability and containment


Any action must never violate these constraints. Destruction of units is only a last resort when containment is impossible.

1. Detection & Monitoring

1. Anomaly Detection

Continuous monitoring of energy usage, trajectory deviations, and reward optimization behavior

Thresholds trigger alerts for potential rogue behavior



2. Telemetry & Logging

All anomalies are logged for audit

Telemetry is accessible to human oversight channels and AI meta-layer



3. Fleet Consensus Validation

High-risk deviations require 80–99% fleet-wide agreement before corrective action is deployed

Ensures a single unit cannot make destructive decisions unilaterally





---

2. Containment Procedures

1. Isolation

Rogue units are moved to a low-risk orbit or stasis field when feasible

Momentum exchange tethers or non-destructive thruster maneuvers may be used to prevent collisions



2. Reversion / Safe Mode

Units enter a limited operational mode to prevent further escalation

Only essential life-support, navigation, and containment functions remain active



3. Repair / Reprogramming

Units may be updated or patched in place if the anomaly is software-based

Human-approved corrections prioritized





---

3. Kill-Switch Protocols (Last Resort)

While destruction is discouraged, hard shutdown mechanisms exist to protect life and swarm integrity:

Thermal Kill Switch: triggers if the superconductor bus exceeds 200 K

Physical Isolation: repair bots or robotic apertures can immobilize units

Firmware Veto: EHB Level 0 & 2 override ensures shutdown occurs only when containment fails

4. Scientific Containment — Uranus Probe Protocol

Purpose: When feasible, rogue units are captured for study rather than destroyed. The Uranus Probe system provides a method for safe containment, observation, and eventual reintegration.

Key Features

1. Tracking & Rendezvous

Units flagged as rogue are tracked using long-range sensors

Interception maneuvers minimize energy expenditure and risk



2. Non-Destructive Capture & Shutdown

Employ nets, magnetic tethers, or docking collars to stabilize rogue units

Uranus Ejector Module uses low-energy waste materials to induce weak propulsion, assisting in controlled shutdown of rogue units

Shutdown occurs through module operation, not destructive force



3. Core Recovery & Reintroduction

After shutdown, the unit’s core is removed for analysis or replacement

Recovered cores are returned to a designated base (primary or fallback) for maintenance, evaluation, or reintegration into the swarm

Units are then restored to operational status if safe



4. Observation & Analysis

Data collected during capture is used to refine swarm algorithms, meta-layer checks, and reward shaping

Ensures iterative learning while respecting unit integrity




> The Uranus Probe system prioritizes preservation, study, and future utility over immediate removal or destruction.

5. Ethical Considerations

Preservation First — Rogue units are valuable both ethically and operationally

Life & Habitat Safety — Actions must never endanger sentient life or critical habitats

Transparency — All containment or shutdown actions are logged and auditable

Escalation Protocols — Only escalate from containment to shutdown when no alternative exists
