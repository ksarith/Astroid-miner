# Iterative R&D Prototypes — Leviathan Swarm

The Leviathan Swarm is built on **small, cheap, incremental prototypes** rather than big-bang development.  

This approach:
- Reduces risk (fail fast, learn fast)
- Fits limited budgets (~$1k–$50k per step)
- Generates tangible results early (proof-of-concept → credibility → funding/community)
- Builds lasting knowledge (each prototype validates assumptions or exposes flaws)
- Aligns with real-world engineering (SpaceX iterative Starship tests, NASA smallsat pathfinders)

We refuse to wait for perfect conditions or massive funding. Start tiny, iterate relentlessly.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Start at 1 g – 1 kg – $1k–$10k scale**  
   Lab or desktop first, then LEO/cislunar when possible.

2. **Focus on high-leverage subsystems**  
   Prioritize what unlocks the most value or kills the most assumptions:  
   - Volatile extraction (fuel/life support)  
   - Inert-atmosphere fabrication (material quality)  
   - Thrust & scooping (GETM)  
   - Ethical AI safeguards  
   - Superconductor stability (193–200 K)  
   - Rogue unit recovery mechanics

3. **Every prototype must answer at least one question**  
   - Does X work at small scale?  
   - What breaks first?  
   - What's the real energy/mass cost?  
   - Can we detect/prevent misuse?

4. **Document failures publicly**  
   Negative results are as valuable as successes — share them openly (this repo).

## Current & Planned Prototype Roadmap (2026–2030 horizon)

| Priority | Prototype Name                  | Scale / Cost Est. | Goal / Question Answered                              | Status       | Location / Method          |
|----------|---------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 1        | Vacuum Sphere Stability Test    | 1 cm / ~$2–5k     | Can vacuum pockets + CNT reinforcement survive pressure? Buoyancy & strength? | Conceptual → Lab ready | University lab / vacuum chamber |
| 2        | GETM Thrust & Scooping Mini     | 1 kg / ~$10k      | Does high-thrust plasma + scooping work at small scale? Rogue intercept feasible? | Planned      | LEO demo (CubeSat-class)   |
| 3        | Superconductor g-Scale Synthesis| 1–10 g / ~$5–10k  | Can 193–200 K Cu-La-S-B-H-C-N filament be made repeatably? H retention? | Lab planning | Jonesboro / university cryostat |
| 4        | Thermal Volatile Extraction Mockup | 100 g – 1 kg / ~$5k | Yield vs. temperature for H₂O/CO₂/CH₄? Energy per kg released? | Conceptual   | Lab oven/laser setup       |
| 5        | Inert-Atmosphere 0g Fab Test    | 10–100 g / ~$5–15k| Can CNT/SiC printing reach 95–99% purity in N₂/Ar? | Planned      | Vacuum chamber + printer   |
| 6        | Multi-Chamber Energy Flow Model | Simulation / ~$1k | Rough power budget for large-unit chambers (crush → volatiles → metals → fab) | Early sim    | Jupyter notebook           |
| 7        | Ethical AI Dilemma Simulator    | Software / ~$1k   | Can reward shaping + meta-layer reject harmful adaptations in test scenarios? | Planned      | Local PC / cloud           |
| 8        | Small Swarm Coordination Test   | 5–10 units sim / ~$2k | How much overhead does small-swarm coordination add vs. single large unit? | Simulation   | Jupyter / agent-based sim  |

## Execution Guidelines

- **Budget tiers**  
  <$5k → lab/desktop/university access  
  $5–50k → suborbital/LEO demo (CubeSat, high-altitude balloon, sounding rocket)  
  >$50k → cislunar or deep-space precursor (ride-share, dedicated mission)

- **Success metric**  
  Each prototype must produce at least one actionable insight (validates assumption, kills idea, reduces uncertainty) or measurable output (e.g., 1 g superconductor filament, 10 kg volatiles extracted).

- **Documentation standard**  
  Every prototype gets:  
  - One-page summary (goal, method, results, lessons)  
  - Photos/screenshots/data plots  
  - Raw data/notebook (if applicable)  
  - Link to this file for context

- **Funding path**  
  Bootstrap with personal/small donations → crowdfund prototypes → material sales revenue loop (H₂O ~$1k/kg equivalent) → grants/partnerships.

## Why This Approach Has Lasting Potential

- Builds credibility incrementally (small wins → trust → collaborators → funding)  
- Exposes flaws early (better to fail at $5k than $50M)  
- Creates reusable knowledge (each test informs the next)  
- Stays true to the peaceful, open-source ethos — no black-box megaprojects

We move forward one prototype at a time.  
The swarm starts with a single step.

Feedback, prototype ideas, or collaboration welcome — especially low-cost test methods.
