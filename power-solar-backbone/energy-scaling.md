# Power Systems & Energy Scaling

## Repository Context

This document defines the **energy backbone** for a self-replicating asteroid-mining swarm, beginning with near-Earth asteroids (NEAs, ~1–1.5 AU) and scaling outward toward the main belt (~2–3.5 AU, e.g., Ceres at 2.8 AU).

Energy availability is the primary constraint on:
- mining throughput
- materials processing
- replication rate
- long-term autonomy

The system is designed around **solar power as the initial, producible backbone**, supplemented by hybrid systems as distance from the Sun increases. The emphasis is on **ISRU compatibility, scalability, and graceful degradation**, not peak efficiency.

---

## Core Design Principles

- **Bootstrap first, optimize later**  
  Early systems prioritize manufacturability and robustness over efficiency.

- **ISRU-first power architecture**  
  Metals (Al, Cu, Fe), silicates, and volatiles mined on-site are used for frames, conductors, ceramics, shielding, and cooling.

- **Thermal before electrical**  
  Direct thermal energy is preferred where possible to avoid unnecessary conversion losses.

- **Distance-aware scaling**  
  Power systems are explicitly designed around declining solar flux with heliocentric distance.

- **Preservation and containment aligned**  
  Power systems support shutdown, capture, and recovery mechanisms (not escalation or weaponization).

## 1. Solar Flux & Distance Scaling

Solar irradiance scales with distance according to the inverse-square law:

Solar Flux ≈ 1366 W/m² × (1 AU / r)²

| Distance (AU) | Approx. Flux (W/m²) | Relative to 1 AU | Operational Implications |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| 1.0          | ~1366               | 100%             | Solar thermal and PV highly viable |
| 1.5          | ~590                | ~43%             | Oversized collectors required |
| 2.0–2.5      | ~340–215            | 25–16%           | Thermal concentration critical |
| 2.8 (Ceres)  | ~150                | ~11%             | Large concentrators + hybrid power |
| 3.5+         | <100                | <7%              | Nuclear dominant, solar supplemental |

**Key implication:**  
Beyond ~2.5 AU, solar systems scale **geometrically in area and mass** for linear gains in power.

## 2. Primary Power Technologies

### 2.1 Solar Thermal Backbone (Phase 1–2)

**Role:** Primary early-stage power and heat source.

- **Materials:** Aluminum/titanium tubing, ceramic receivers, reflective metal foils
- **Manufacturing:** Induction melting, centrifugal casting, simple forming
- **Architecture:**  
  Parabolic or trough concentrators → heat pipes/tubes →  
  either direct thermal use or thermoelectric conversion

**Conversion paths:**
- Direct heat for smelting, extrusion, sintering
- Thermopiles / Peltier elements (≈5–10% electrical efficiency)

**Advantages**
- Extremely ISRU-friendly
- Minimal electronics
- Direct coupling to industrial processes

**Challenges**
- Thermal cycling fatigue
- Fluid handling in micro-g (wicked heat pipes)
- Micrometeoroid protection (regolith shielding)

**Target output**
- Early units: ~100–500 W equivalent
- Mature replicated units: 1–5 kW equivalent

---

### 2.2 Photovoltaics (Phase 2–3)

**Role:** Stable electrical baseline for computing, sensors, and communications.

- High-efficiency GaAs or multijunction cells (30–40%)
- Thin-film silicon possible later via ISRU
- Deployable, sun-tracking arrays

PV is **complementary**, not dominant, in early industrial phases due to fabrication complexity.

---

### 2.3 Nuclear Power (Reliability Layer)

**Role:** Continuity, shadowed operations, and deep-space viability.

- **RTGs:**  
  - ~100 W class for seed units and fail-safe power
- **Small fission units:**  
  - ~1–10 kW range for high-load processing or low-solar environments
  - Shielding fabricated from asteroid metals/regolith

Nuclear systems are **supporting elements**, not the primary growth driver.

---

### 2.4 Orbital Solar Rings & Farms (Long-Horizon Scaling)

**Role:** High-availability, centralized power hubs.

- Sun-synchronous or equatorial orbital rings
- Continuous exposure (no diurnal cycling)
- Multi-use:
  - Energy distribution
  - Beamed power
  - Data processing
  - Communications relay

**Ceres-scale application**
- Power backbone for layered industrial growth
- Feedstock for long-term planet-scale construction

**Transmission**
- Superconductor interconnects (high-Tc materials)
- Loss minimization prioritized over power density

## 3. Energy Budget per Replication Cycle

Order-of-magnitude estimates:

- **Total per replication cycle:** ~1–10 MWh  
  (strongly process-dependent)

**Breakdown**
- Acquisition & anchoring: 0.1–0.5 MWh  
- Processing & fabrication: 0.5–5 MWh (dominant term)  
- AI, sensors, communications: 0.1–0.5 MWh  
- Propulsion & logistics: variable (uses mined propellant)

**Operational profile**
- Baseline: ~200–500 W per mature unit
- Peak loads: 1–10 kW during fabrication

**Scaling heuristic**
- Replication count doubles
- Energy demand grows ~1.5–2× per generation  
  (efficiency gains partially offset added complexity)

---

## 4. Protection & Resilience

- **Thermal control:** Radiators, heat pipes, regolith insulation
- **Radiation tolerance:** Dormant spares, ECC memory, TMR logic
- **Debris mitigation:** Distributed layouts, low-energy interception
- **Containment alignment:** Power systems support controlled shutdown and capture (see Rogue Unit Management)
