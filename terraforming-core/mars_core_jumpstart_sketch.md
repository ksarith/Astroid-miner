# Mars Core Jumpstart Sketch

The long-term goal is to restart Mars’ global magnetic dynamo to generate a protective magnetosphere (~0.1–0.3 G at surface), shielding the atmosphere from solar wind stripping and enabling open-air liquid water and plant growth at scale.

**Current status**: purely conceptual. No serious modeling or experiments have been done. This is a whiteboard-level sketch to outline the problem and a possible path.

## Why a dynamo matters

Mars lost its global magnetic field ~4 Ga ago → unprotected atmosphere → solar wind stripped most of it → current pressure 0.006 bar, no liquid water stability, high radiation.

A renewed dynamo would:
- Deflect solar wind → retain 1 bar atmosphere long-term
- Reduce surface radiation dose → enable open-air farming and settlement
- Allow stable water cycle → oceans, rivers, higher biomass O₂ production

Without it, any terraformed atmosphere is temporary (centuries to millennia timescale loss).

## Current best-estimate core state (2025)

- Radius: ~1 700 km
- Composition: Fe-Ni-S core (likely partially molten outer layer, solid inner)
- Temperature: 1 500–2 200 K (estimates vary widely)
- Heat flow: very low (~0.03 W/m² from InSight)
- Convection: insufficient or absent → no dynamo

To restart convection we need:
- Raise core temperature enough to melt more material (~2 800–3 500 K range?)
- Induce large-scale fluid motion (magnetic pulse, tidal forcing, compositional buoyancy…)

## Proposed jumpstart sequence (very high-level)

1. **Deep mining phase**  
   - Drill 100–500 km into Mars crust/mantle  
   - Extract Fe-Ni and silicates → expose hotter material (~1 000–5 000 K depending on depth)  
   - Use extracted mass for swarm replication or surface industry

2. **Laser heating phase**  
   - Concentrate swarm laser power (10 kW/module class) onto boreholes or surface spots  
   - Heat large volumes of mantle/core-adjacent material to increase buoyancy & convection  
   - Goal: create localized hot plumes that drive large-scale flow

3. **Magnetic pulse phase**  
   - Deploy large superconductor coils in boreholes or orbit  
   - Discharge 10²⁰–10²² J pulses (10 T fields) to induce Lorentz forces in conductive fluid  
   - Seed initial magnetic field → amplify via dynamo action if convection is strong enough

4. **Sustainment phase**  
   - Continuous low-level heating + stirring to prevent solidification  
   - Monitor via seismic network (InSight-like stations)  
   - Adjust with additional pulses or beamed power as needed

## Key technical assumptions

- Superconductor coils can be manufactured in situ (CNT + Cu-La-S-B-H-C-N, 200 K operation)  
- Swarm can deliver TW-scale power to Mars surface (1.5 AU solar farm backbone)  
- Deep drilling feasible with SiC tools and swarm robotics (100–500 km depth)  
- Initial seed field from pulses can be amplified by convection (dynamo theory threshold)

## Massive open questions (2026)

- Realistic energy to melt sufficient core volume (~10²⁵–10²⁷ J?)  
- Depth vs temperature trade-off (how deep before heat flow kills the drill?)  
- Quake risk — can swarm survive induced seismicity?  
- Pulse delivery method (orbital rings? Borehole coils? Beamed microwave?)  
- Minimum dynamo field strength to retain atmosphere (~0.01 G? 0.1 G?)  
- Timescale — decades? centuries? millennia?  
- Fallback if core is fully solid — artificial magnetosphere instead?

This is extremely speculative.  
Even optimistic assumptions put this at 2070–2120 earliest plausible attempt.

The real value of sketching it now is to identify the biggest mass & energy hurdles early — so we can design the swarm to eventually solve them.
