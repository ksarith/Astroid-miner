# Contributing to Asteroid Mining Concepts

Thank you for considering contributing!  
This is an open scratch-pad for ideas, calculations, and sketches around asteroid mining and space industrialization.  
It is deliberately early-stage and incomplete — your input can help make it more useful.

## What we welcome

- Corrections to assumptions, math, or logic  
- Better / more realistic numbers, references, or sources  
- New calculations, parametric models, or Jupyter notebooks  
- Diagrams, flowcharts, or architecture sketches (even hand-drawn scans)  
- Papers, patents, videos, forum threads, or sci-fi references worth including  
- Criticism — especially if it’s specific and constructive  
- Alternative approaches, failure modes, or “what if” scenarios  
- Typos, clearer wording, better organization  

You do **not** need to be an expert.  
One good reference link or one fixed equation is already valuable.

## How to contribute

### Small changes (typos, wording, links)

1. Fork the repo  
2. Make your change on a new branch  
3. Open a pull request with a short description  
4. That’s it

### Larger contributions (new section, model, calculation)

1. **Open an issue first** (preferred)  
   - Describe what you want to add  
   - Link any existing work (paper, notebook, sketch)  
   - We can discuss scope & placement before you write code

2. Or jump straight to a pull request if you prefer  
   - Put new content in the most logical folder (or suggest a new one)  
   - Include a short “why this matters” paragraph at the top  
   - Add yourself to the contributors list if you want credit

### Code & notebooks

- Use Python 3 (preferably 3.10+)  
- Jupyter notebooks are very welcome (clear cells, comments, plots)  
- Keep dependencies minimal (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, poliastro if orbital)  
- No external APIs or paid services  
- Add a short header comment: purpose, assumptions, units, limitations

### References & reading list

- Add to `references-and-reading/must_read_papers_and_books.md`  
- One-line description + link + why it’s useful  
- Prefer open-access or arXiv when possible

### Diagrams & visuals

- Mermaid for flowcharts & simple diagrams is ideal (renders in GitHub)  
- Draw.io / Excalidraw / ASCII art / scanned sketches are all fine  
- Name files clearly (e.g., `mass_flow_sankey_v1.drawio`)

## Code of Conduct

Be kind, be specific, assume good faith.  
No personal attacks, no spam, no crypto/NFT promotion.

## Questions?

Just open an issue — even if it’s “I don’t know where to put this” or “is this idea crazy?”  
We’re all learning.

Thanks for helping move the ball forward ☄️
