## Architecture — High Level

The `architecture-high-level/` folder defines the foundational structure of the Astroid-miner system. These documents establish the system’s architectural philosophy, swarm dynamics, stability considerations, redundancy strategies, and large-scale module concepts. This layer informs all downstream design decisions.

- **[Concepts.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/architecture-high-level/Concepts.md)** — Establishes the core conceptual framework of the system, outlining high-level design assumptions, guiding principles, and architectural intent.

- **[Swarm vs Monolith vs Hybrid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/architecture-high-level/swarm-vs-monolith-vs-hybrid.md)** — Compares centralized, distributed, and hybrid system architectures, explaining why swarm-based approaches offer superior resilience, scalability, and fault tolerance for long-duration autonomous operations.

- **[Zero Spheres Stability](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/architecture-high-level/zero-spheres-stability.md)** — Examines stability considerations for spherical or near-spherical structures, including rotational dynamics, anchoring strategies, and force distribution in low- and micro-gravity environments.

## Power — Solar Backbone

The `power-solar-backbone/` folder explores the foundational energy infrastructure required to support large-scale autonomous mining, processing, fabrication, and logistics across the Solar System. These documents examine how energy generation, transmission, and scaling must evolve to sustain non-human industrial systems operating over astronomical distances and timescales.

- **[Energy Scaling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/power-solar-backbone/energy-scaling.md)** — Analyzes how available solar energy scales with distance from the Sun and the implications this has for system architecture, mission planning, and power budgeting across AU-scale operations.

- **[Superconductor Interconnect Proposal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/power-solar-backbone/superconductor_interconnect_proposal.md)** — Proposes the use of superconducting interconnects for high-efficiency power transmission between distributed solar collectors, processing nodes, and industrial units.

- **[1.5 AU Solar Farm Concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/power-solar-backbone/1.5_AU_solar_farm_concept.md)** — Describes a conceptual solar farm positioned at approximately 1.5 AU, examining tradeoffs between solar flux, orbital stability, material availability, and integration into a system-wide energy backbone.


## Propulsion — Economy & ISRU

The `Propulsion_Economy_isru/` folder addresses mobility as an economic and systemic problem rather than a purely mechanical one. These documents examine how autonomous units move, reposition, anchor, and apply force using locally available resources, low-value reaction mass, and long-duration thrust strategies. Propulsion is treated as a continuous, integrated capability rather than a discrete burn-based event.

- **[Magnetic Drive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/refs/heads/main/Propulsion_Economy_isru/Magnetic_Drive.md)** — Proposes a non-traditional thrust mechanism based on electromagnetic interaction, emphasizing low-thrust, long-duration force application suitable for gradual repositioning, towing, and orbital shaping.

- **[Low-Value Acquisitions Strategy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/Propulsion_Economy_isru/low-value-acquisitions_strategy.md)** — Outlines a propulsion economy that prioritizes abundant, low-value materials as reaction mass, preserving high-value resources while enabling scalable and repeatable movement.

- **[GETM — Gas Extraction & Thrust Module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/Propulsion_Economy_isru/module-getm.md)** — Describes a modular system that couples gas extraction directly with thrust generation, closing the loop between resource acquisition and propulsion.

- **[Zero-G Collection & Anchoring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/Propulsion_Economy_isru/zero-g-collection-anchoring.md)** — Examines methods for stabilizing, anchoring, and interacting with objects in microgravity, enabling controlled extraction, fabrication, and force transfer without reliance on gravity wells.

- **[Zero-G Fabrication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/Propulsion_Economy_isru/zero_g_fabrication.md)** — Explores fabrication techniques optimized for zero-gravity environments, where traditional assumptions about tooling, material flow, and structural support no longer apply.


## Terraforming Core — Planetary Engineering Sketches (Long Horizon)
The terraforming-core/ folder explores planetary-scale engineering as a downstream consequence of autonomous mining, energy abundance, and orbital control. These documents are not execution plans, but structured sketches intended to remain dormant until enabling technologies (energy scaling, mass transport, AI coordination) make them actionable.
Terraforming here is treated as systems engineering, not habitation-first colonization. Human presence is explicitly non-essential in early phases; stabilization and conditioning precede biology.

- **[Martian Atmosphere](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/refs/heads/main/terraforming-core/Martian_Atmosphere.md)** - This document examines Mars’ atmosphere as a manipulable system rather than a static deficiency. It outlines atmospheric loss mechanisms, pressure targets, and potential replenishment pathways without assuming immediate biological viability. The framing emphasizes retention first, thickening second, acknowledging that atmosphere generation without magnetic or thermal stabilization is self-defeating.

- Oversight note: This file implicitly depends on later core and orbital conditioning work; cross-links to mars_core_jumpstart_sketch.md and planetary_orbital_conditioning.md may strengthen continuity.

- **[Ceres as a Planet-Building Seed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/terraforming-core/ceres-planet-building.md)** - Ceres is positioned not as a destination, but as a logistical and material nucleus for planetary construction. The document frames Ceres as an intermediary between asteroid mining and planet-scale assembly, leveraging its composition, location, and mass as a staging ground for water, volatiles, and refined materials.

- This is a keystone concept: Ceres is where mining transitions into planetary metabolism.

- **[Ceres Metabolic Nucleus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/refs/heads/main/terraforming-core/ceres_metabolic_nucleus.md)** -Expanding on the previous file, this sketch treats Ceres as a living industrial system — a refinery, buffer, and distribution hub feeding long-duration planetary engineering efforts. Material flows, refinement loops, and energy coupling are implied rather than finalized, reinforcing the idea that planets are built by process continuity, not one-time interventions.

- Refinement opportunity: This file could explicitly reference Lazarus Forge processing logic to tighten philosophical alignment.

- **[Mars Core Jumpstart Sketch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/terraforming-core/mars_core_jumpstart_sketch.md)** - This document addresses one of Mars’ foundational problems: the absence of a sustaining magnetic field. It speculates on methods to reintroduce or simulate core dynamics, framing magnetic field restoration as a prerequisite rather than a luxury. The sketch remains intentionally speculative, acknowledging physics uncertainties while preserving engineering intent.

- This is one of the clearest examples of “science fiction awaiting capability” in the repository — appropriately so.

- **[Mars Atmosphere Bootstrapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/terraforming-core/mars_atmosphere_bootstrapping.md)** - Complementing the core jumpstart, this file explores staged atmosphere construction once retention mechanisms exist. It avoids naive “add gas” narratives, instead treating atmospheric growth as a feedback-managed process tied to surface temperature, pressure thresholds, and loss mitigation.

- Together with the core sketch, this forms a paired system: retain → thicken → stabilize.

- **[Planetary Orbital Conditioning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/refs/heads/main/terraforming-core/planetary_orbital_conditioning.md)** - This document broadens terraforming Terraforming Core — Planetary Engineering Sketches (Long Horizon)
  
- The terraforming-core/ folder explores planetary-scale engineering as a long-horizon consequence of autonomous mining, energy abundance, and orbital control. These documents are intentionally speculative engineering sketches rather than execution plans, designed to remain dormant until enabling capabilities (energy scaling, mass transport, AI coordination) make them viable.

- Terraforming is treated here as systems engineering, not habitation-first colonization. Early phases prioritize stabilization, retention, and conditioning; human presence is optional until planetary systems reach durable equilibrium.

- Martian Atmosphere — Examines Mars’ atmosphere as a manipulable system rather than a static deficiency. It outlines atmospheric loss mechanisms, pressure targets, and replenishment pathways, emphasizing retention before thickening and acknowledging that atmosphere generation without magnetic or thermal stabilization is self-defeating.

- Ceres as a Planet-Building Seed — Positions Ceres as a logistical and material nucleus rather than a destination. The document frames Ceres as an intermediary between asteroid mining and planet-scale assembly, leveraging its composition, location, and mass to stage water, volatiles, and refined materials.

- Ceres Metabolic Nucleus — Expands the Ceres concept into a living industrial system: a refinery, buffer, and distribution hub supporting long-duration planetary engineering. Material flows, refinement loops, and energy coupling are implied rather than finalized, reinforcing the idea that planets are built through sustained processes, not single interventions.

- Mars Core Jumpstart Sketch — Addresses Mars’ lack of a sustaining magnetic field by exploring speculative methods to reintroduce or simulate core dynamics. Magnetic field restoration is framed as a prerequisite for atmospheric stability rather than a secondary enhancement, with physics uncertainties explicitly acknowledged.

- Mars Atmosphere Bootstrapping — Explores staged atmospheric construction once retention mechanisms exist. The document avoids naive “add gas” approaches, instead treating atmosphere growth as a feedback-managed process tied to temperature, pressure thresholds, and loss mitigation.

- Planetary Orbital Conditioning — Extends terraforming beyond chemistry and geology by asserting that planetary orbits themselves become adjustable parameters given sufficient time and reaction mass. It sketches long-horizon orbital nudging and positioning strategies that allow thermal input and climate stability to be tuned rather than accepted as fixed.

- Across these files, terraforming is not treated as a mission objective but as an emergent outcome of autonomous extraction, fabrication, propulsion, and energy scaling. Once a system can move mass, process material, and coordinate over centuries, planetary conditioning becomes a question of when, not if.
Human involvement remains optional until stability is achieved.
