## Vision — Philosophy

These files capture strategic, ethical, and long-horizon thinking for the Astroid-miner project:

- **[Interstellar Seeding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/refs/heads/main/vision-philosophy/Interstellar_Seeding.md)** — Lays out a doctrine for how and why autonomous industrial seeds should precede human colonization in interstellar space. It discusses role, autonomy, preparation, and ethical constraints on expansion beyond the Solar System.

- **[Safety Lights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/refs/heads/main/vision-philosophy/Safety_Lights.md)** — Discusses strategies for ensuring safe operation of long-lived autonomous systems, including architectural safety guardrails, hazard signaling, and systemic indicators that guide risk-aware behaviors in distributed fleets.

- **[Rogue Unit Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/refs/heads/main/vision-philosophy/Rogue_unit_management.md)** — Explores how to identify, contain, and recover units that diverge from expected behavior or constraints. It frames rogue behavior as a risk state requiring detection, isolation, and resolution without undermining the broader swarm mission.

- **[Oceanic Tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/refs/heads/main/vision-philosophy/Oceanic_Tests.md)** — Describes the rationale for using deep ocean environments as analog testing grounds for autonomy that must cope with extreme conditions, limited communication, and mechanical stress before space deployment.

- **[Ethical AI Frameworks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/vision-philosophy/ethical-ai-frameworks.md)** — A layered ethical architecture for the project’s distributed artificial intelligence. It combines hard safety constraints, reward shaping, meta-ethical evaluation, and human oversight to prevent harmful behaviors while enabling adaptive autonomy.

- **[Self-Evolving AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/vision-philosophy/self-evolving-ai.md)** — Focuses on architectural patterns and resilience in self-modifying or self-evolving AI systems, especially concerning power systems, redundancy, fault tolerance, and long-term autonomy.



## Architecture — High Level

The `architecture-high-level/` folder defines the foundational structure of the Astroid-miner system. These documents establish the system’s architectural philosophy, swarm dynamics, stability considerations, redundancy strategies, and large-scale module concepts. This layer informs all downstream design decisions.

- **[Concepts.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/architecture-high-level/Concepts.md)** — Establishes the core conceptual framework of the system, outlining high-level design assumptions, guiding principles, and architectural intent.

- **[Swarm vs Monolith vs Hybrid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/architecture-high-level/swarm-vs-monolith-vs-hybrid.md)** — Compares centralized, distributed, and hybrid system architectures, explaining why swarm-based approaches offer superior resilience, scalability, and fault tolerance for long-duration autonomous operations.

- **[Zero Spheres Stability](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/architecture-high-level/zero-spheres-stability.md)** — Examines stability considerations for spherical or near-spherical structures, including rotational dynamics, anchoring strategies, and force distribution in low- and micro-gravity environments.

- **[Uranus Ejector Module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/architecture-high-level/uranus_ejector_module.md)** — Describes a large-scale ejector module concept designed for mass transfer, material ejection, or momentum exchange within extreme planetary or orbital environments.

- **[System Architecture Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/main/architecture-high-level/system_architecture_overview.md)** — Provides a consolidated overview of the complete system architecture, tying together unit roles, autonomy layers, logistics, processing, and control structures.

- **[Fault-Tolerant Power Control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/refs/heads/main/architecture-high-level/Fault-Tolerant-Power-Control.md)** — Details redundancy strategies, power routing, and failure isolation mechanisms that allow the system to continue operating despite partial subsystem loss.

- **[Roles Doctrine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/refs/heads/main/architecture-high-level/Roles_Doctrine.md)** — Defines the doctrine of generalized units with emergent, context-driven roles, rejecting rigid specialization in favor of adaptive, fabrication-enabled role biasing.

## Notes on Swarm Notebooks
- Git command (locally): `git rm notebooks/Swarm_replication_growth.ipynb` then commit/push.
- Update any internal links to point to the kept file.

## Next Steps / Planned
- Consider adding `docs/` or `zero-g-challenges/` folder for better organization
- Expand notebooks: power scaling, quenching sims, more delta-v models
- Create visual diagrams (swarm growth, Ceres layering, Uranus Ejector flow diagram)
- Benchmark against real-world efforts (AstroForge, TransAstra, NASA ISRU studies)

Open issues, PRs, and discussions are very welcome.  
This is an evolving, collaborative exploration of self-sustaining asteroid mining and far beyond.
