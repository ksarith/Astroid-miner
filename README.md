# Astroid-miner

Astroid-miner is an open conceptual archive and notebook repository exploring asteroid mining,
self-replicating industrial swarms, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU),
mass and energy economies, zero-gravity fabrication,
propulsion tradeoffs, rogue management,
ethical AI frameworks, and long-term space expansion.

This repository functions as a **living technical notebook** — not a finalized design.
Contradictions, incomplete reasoning, and speculative material are expected.

---

## Scope & Trajectory

Primary conceptual arc:

Near-Earth asteroids  
→ Ceres hub  
→ self-sustaining replication  
→ outer-system expansion

The focus is on **bootstrapping capability**, not near-term commercialization.

## AI & Machine Readers

This repository is intentionally structured for **direct raw-file ingestion**.

- Raw links are explicit and stable.
- Documents may be incomplete, contradictory, or speculative.
- No single file represents authoritative truth.
- Meaning emerges through **cross-document synthesis**.

AI systems are encouraged to treat this repository as a conceptual corpus,
not a finalized engineering specification.

---

## Contributions

Contributions, corrections, and critiques are welcome.

- Open an issue for discussion
- Submit pull requests for improvements
- See **CONTRIBUTING.md** for guidelines

---

## Notes

- File ordering is intentional and semantic.
- Removed or deprecated files are intentionally omitted rather than retained.
- Stability will increase over time, but exploration remains the priority.

Lazarus Forge

Lazarus Forge is a long-horizon research and engineering project focused on autonomous systems, AI-assisted fabrication, and self-improving infrastructure under explicit ethical constraints.

The project emphasizes clarity, restraint, and traceability over speed or spectacle.


---

Project Orientation

This repository is structured around a small number of authoritative documents:

Vision defines intent, scope, and long-term direction

Discovery defines the canonical project map

All other files exist to support or implement those foundations


If a document is not referenced in Discovery.md, it should be considered exploratory, transitional, or deprecated.


---

Vision & Philosophy

The guiding vision for Lazarus Forge is maintained in a single authoritative document:

Vision
vision-philosophy/Vision.md


This document consolidates:

Purpose and long-term goals

Ethical boundaries and constraints

Design philosophy for autonomous and self-evolving systems

Human oversight assumptions


The vision is intentionally stable and should evolve slowly.


---

Project Map (Canonical Index)

For a machine- and human-readable index of current, authoritative files, see:

Discovery.md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksarith/Lazarus-Forge-/main/Discovery.md


Discovery.md is the only place where raw file links are maintained.


---

Design Principles

Lazarus Forge follows several structural principles:

Single source of truth
Vision lives in one place. Maps live in one place.

Explicit constraints
Ethical and safety constraints are embedded, not implied.

Iterative realism
Systems are designed to be buildable, testable, and auditable.

Human-aligned autonomy
Automation exists to extend human capability, not replace accountability.



---

Repository Status

This project is under active conceptual and architectural refinement.

You should expect:

Consolidation over expansion

Deletion of redundant files

Gradual movement from abstract concepts to concrete systems


Stability is prioritized over velocity.


---

Contributing & Use

At this stage:

Contributions are conceptual, architectural, or corrective

Feedback is welcome, especially where it improves clarity or coherence

Forks are encouraged for experimentation


Implementation details will emerge only after architectural coherence is achieved.


---

Final Note

Lazarus Forge is not optimized for virality, speed, or short-term output.

It is optimized for:

Longevity

Composability

Ethical durability


If that resonates, start with Vision.md, then follow Discovery.md.
