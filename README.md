 # Astroid-miner

Open notebook for asteroid mining concepts, ISRU architectures, mass/energy budgets, and self-replicating swarm ideas.

**Leviathan Swarm vision**: hybrid small-unit swarm + optional large "monster" units to process large asteroids, bootstrap space industry, and support long-term human expansion (Ceres spheres, Mars terraforming precursors, orbital power).

Early / pre-alpha — public brain dump of calculations, sketches, and reference materials.

## Repository Structure (for humans & AI)

- **[architecture-high-level/](architecture-high-level/)** → swarm vs monolith vs hybrid philosophy, core concepts  
  - Concepts.md  
  - swarm-vs-monolith-vs-hybrid.md  

- **[Propulsion_Economy_isru/](Propulsion_Economy_isru/)** → delta-v budgets, reaction mass economy, low-value acquisition strategy  

- **[vision-philosophy/](vision-philosophy/)** → guiding principles, motivation, ethics  

- **[terraforming-core/](terraforming-core/)** → Mars atmosphere bootstrapping, core jumpstart sketches  

- **[rogue-management/](rogue-management/)** → rogue unit detection, recovery protocols  

- **[power-solar-backbone/](power-solar-backbone/)** → 1.5 AU solar farm, superconductor interconnect ideas  

- **[notebooks/](notebooks/)** → early Jupyter simulations (delta-v, volatiles, swarm growth)  

- **[docs/](docs/)** → focused module docs (GETM, safety/ethics, large-unit concept)  

## Core Reading (start here)

- [architecture-high-level/Concepts.md](architecture-high-level/Concepts.md) — overall swarm philosophy    
- [Propulsion_Economy_isru/delta-v_and_reaction_mass_economy.md](Propulsion_Economy_isru/delta-v_and_reaction_mass_economy.md) — key propulsion math  

## Status & What's Next

Very early stage: conceptual docs, early notebooks, scattered notes. No production code yet.

Planned:  
- More notebooks (GETM thrust profiles, chamber energy flows)  
- Diagrams & sketches (/images/)  
- Deeper dives (zero spheres, staged pressure builds, ethical AI evolution)  

Stars, issues, and forks help signal interest — contributions welcome (ideas, calculations, criticism).

**Once in space the Lazarus Forge will be able to spread its wings. It will escape the confines of Earth.**
