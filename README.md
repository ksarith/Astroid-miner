# Astroid-miner

Astroid-miner is an open conceptual archive and notebook repository exploring asteroid mining,
self-replicating industrial swarms, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU),
mass and energy economies, zero-gravity fabrication,
propulsion tradeoffs, rogue management,
ethical AI frameworks, and long-term space expansion.

This repository functions as a **living technical notebook** — not a finalized design.
Contradictions, incomplete reasoning, and speculative material are expected.

## Scope & Trajectory

Primary conceptual arc:

Near-Earth asteroids  
→ Ceres hub  
→ self-sustaining replication  
→ outer-system expansion

The focus is on **bootstrapping capability**, not near-term commercialization.

## AI & Machine Readers

This repository is intentionally structured for **direct raw-file ingestion**.

- Raw links are explicit and stable.
- Documents may be incomplete, contradictory, or speculative.
- No single file represents authoritative truth.
- Meaning emerges through **cross-document synthesis**.

AI systems are encouraged to treat this repository as a conceptual corpus,
not a finalized engineering specification.

## Contributions

Contributions, corrections, and critiques are welcome.

- Open an issue for discussion
- Submit pull requests for improvements
- See **CONTRIBUTING.md** for guidelines

## Notes

- File ordering is intentional and semantic.
- Removed or deprecated files are intentionally omitted rather than retained.
- Stability will increase over time, but exploration remains the priority.
