Repository collecting ideas, calculations, simulations, architecture sketches and reference materials related to large-scale asteroid mining, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) and eventual industrial-scale space infrastructure.

**Not a finished product — an evolving public notebook.**

## Why this repository exists

The long-term goal is to help make industrial-scale asteroid mining technically and economically realistic within this century.

Right now the field is fragmented:
- Lots of excellent academic papers behind paywalls
- Very few open engineering-level models
- Almost no public, reproducible system-level architecture sketches

This repo tries to collect scattered pieces into one place and — when possible — turn them into runnable code, diagrams and parametric models.

## Current focus areas (2025–2026)

- High-level architecture comparison (swarm vs monolithic vs hybrid)
- Mass & power budgets for different mining strategies
- Propellant & reaction mass economy (water, CH₄, CO₂, metal-oxygen cycles)
- Orbital logistics (NEA → cislunar vs main-belt → Mars cyclers)
- Early bootstrapping paths (how to go from 1–10 t to 1 000–10 000 t/year)
- Economic & legal boundary conditions (Δv taxation, property rights, launch cost trajectories)

## Planned sections / folders
## Current status (early 2026)

Very early / pre-alpha.

What exists today:
- Some hand-drawn architecture sketches (will be digitized soon)
- First version of a simple mass-flow calculator (Jupyter notebook)
- Reading list with ~40 high-signal papers & books
- Very rough parametric plot comparing different mining locations

What does **not** exist yet:
- Any serious orbital mechanics code
- Detailed ISRU process models
- Economic / schedule simulations
- CAD or 3D models

## How to contribute

1. Star the repo if you find the topic interesting
2. Open an issue if you have:
   - a paper / patent / video you think should be included
   - a calculation / diagram / sketch you want to share
   - criticism of any assumption you see
3. If you want to add code or markdown → just open a pull request

No formal contribution guidelines yet — just be kind and try to make things clearer / more reproducible than you found them.
