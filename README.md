# Astroid-miner

A long-horizon technical notebook exploring autonomous asteroid mining, self-replicating industrial swarms, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), energy and propulsion economies, zero-gravity fabrication, planetary conditioning, and ethically constrained machine intelligence.

This repository is **not a finished design**.  
It is a **living engineering sketchbook**: ideas evolve, contradict, collapse, and re-emerge as assumptions improve.

> Once in space, the Lazarus Forge does not merely operate — it adapts, persists, and propagates.

## Scope & Trajectory

**Near-Earth Asteroids → Ceres Industrial Nucleus → Self-Sustaining Replication → Outer System Expansion**

The focus is not short-term commercialization, but **capability bootstrapping**:
- autonomy before scale  
- stability before habitation  
- logistics before biology  

Terraforming, interstellar seeding, and planetary conditioning are treated as *downstream consequences*, not primary goals.

---

## Leviathan → Lazarus Forge → Astroid-miner

The Astroid-miner project descends from two prior conceptual threads:

- **Leviathan**  
  A hypothesized autonomous test unit designed for **deep-ocean deployment** — harsh pressure, corrosion, isolation, limited communication, and high failure cost.  
  The premise: any system that can survive, learn, and self-correct in the abyss can adapt to space.

- **Lazarus Forge**  
  A salvage-first, ethics-bound autonomous industrial framework focused on recovery, reuse, and adaptive fabrication under constraint.  
  Lazarus Forge defines the **processing philosophy**, **ethical limits**, and **self-evolution rules**.

**Astroid-miner** represents the point where those ideas leave Earth entirely:
- raw matter becomes feedstock  
- logistics span AU distances  
- autonomy must function for decades to centuries

## Design Principles

- **Single source of truth**  
  Vision and Discovery documents define authority; README summarizes, not overrides.

- **Explicit constraints**  
  Safety, ethical, and containment rules are embedded architecturally, not assumed.

- **Iterative realism**  
  Systems should be inspectable, auditable, and incrementally improvable — even when speculative.

- **Human-aligned autonomy**  
  Automation extends human reach without removing accountability or oversight.

- **Forge-based processing logic**  
  Space resources are treated as *distributed functional feedstock*, not simple ore — demanding autonomous ISRU, refinement, and fabrication loops.

---

## Authoritative Vision

The guiding intent, ethics, and long-term philosophy are maintained in a stable canonical document:

- **Vision**  
  `vision-philosophy/Vision.md`

This document consolidates:
- purpose and long-term trajectory  
- ethical boundaries and override principles  
- assumptions governing autonomous and self-evolving systems  

All architectural, operational, and speculative work defers to this vision.

## AI & Machine Readers

This repository is intentionally structured for:
- raw-file ingestion  
- cross-document synthesis  
- long-context reasoning  

**Discovery.md is the entry point.**  
Individual documents may be speculative or contradictory by design — coherence emerges through synthesis, not any single file.

## Contributions

Critical review, issues, pull requests, and discussion are welcome — especially on:
- ISRU feasibility  
- swarm resilience  
- propulsion and energy economics  
- ethical containment and failure modes  

See **CONTRIBUTING.md** for contribution guidelines.

## Related Project — Lazarus Forge

**Lazarus Forge** explores autonomous industrial recovery, fabrication, and governance under strict ethical constraints in Earth-proximate environments.

Astroid-miner is its **long-horizon extrapolation** once replication, autonomy, and logistics escape planetary gravity wells.

**Last major README update:** January 2026- **Iterative realism** — Systems should be testable, auditable, and incrementally improvable.  
- **Human-aligned autonomy** — Automation extends human capabilities; it does not replace oversight.
- **Lazarus Forge principles** — naturally extend into the Astroid-miner architecture when we consider space resources not as raw ore, but as distributed functional feedstock needing autonomous ISRU.

## Authoritative Vision

The guiding vision is maintained in a single, stable document:

- **Vision**  
  `vision-philosophy/Vision.md` (canonical source for intent, ethics, and long-term design)

This document consolidates:
- Purpose and long-term goals  
- Ethical boundaries and constraints  
- Design philosophy for autonomous and self-evolving systems  

All design and operational decisions defer to this vision.

- Use **Discovery.md** as the entry point for all links and structure.  
- Documents may be speculative or contradictory — truth emerges from synthesis, not any single file.
