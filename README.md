# Astroid-miner

Open conceptual notebook exploring asteroid mining, self-replicating industrial swarms, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), mass/energy economies, zero-gravity fabrication, propulsion tradeoffs, rogue management, ethical AI frameworks, and long-term space expansion.

This is a **living technical notebook** — expect contradictions, incomplete ideas, and rapid evolution. Not a finalized design.

> Once in space, the Lazarus Forge will be able to spread its wings.

## Scope & Trajectory

Near-Earth asteroids → Ceres hub → self-sustaining replication → outer-system expansion

Focus: bootstrapping capability over near-term commercialization.

## AI & Machine Readers

This repo is built for raw-file ingestion and cross-document synthesis.  
- Use **Discovery.md** as the entry point for all links and structure.  
- Documents may be speculative or contradictory — truth emerges from synthesis, not any single file.

## Contributions

Issues, pull requests, critiques, and discussions welcome — especially on ISRU realism, swarm dynamics, energy models, or ethical boundaries.  
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ksarith/Astroid-miner/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

## Related Project: Lazarus Forge

Lazarus Forge is the foundational Earth-side / near-term research thread: salvage-first adaptive recovery, functional preservation, and self-improving infrastructure under strict ethical constraints.  
Astroid-miner represents its logical long-horizon extension once replication capability reaches orbit/space.
